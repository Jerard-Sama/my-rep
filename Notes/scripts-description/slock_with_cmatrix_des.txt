Explanation

    Run cmatrix:
        The cmatrix -b & command starts cmatrix in the background.
        The & allows the script to continue without waiting for cmatrix to finish.

    Store the Process ID:
        $! stores the Process ID (PID) of the last background command, i.e., cmatrix.

    Run slock:
        The script launches slock, which will lock the screen.

    Kill cmatrix:
        When slock exits (upon unlocking the screen), the script kills the cmatrix process using its PID.

Adding the reset Command:

    The reset command resets the terminal to its default state, restoring any altered modes caused by cmatrix or other programs.
    This ensures the terminal can properly display input and output after unlocking.

Gracefully Killing cmatrix:

    The kill $CMATRIX_PID command terminates cmatrix after slock unlocks.

Save Shell History (history -a):

    The history -a command appends the current shell session's history to the .bash_history (or equivalent) file.

Reset Terminal:

    The reset command restores the terminal's state, clearing the screen but also resetting the terminal environment.

Reload Shell History (history -r):

    The history -r command reloads the history from the history file, including the commands saved by history -a.
